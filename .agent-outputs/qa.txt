QA SUMMARY - PDF Tarot Reader
================================================================================
Project: proj_hfuezl_1765954623183
QA Tester: Quinn
Date: 2025-12-17
================================================================================

VERDICT: NOT READY FOR RELEASE
------------------------------

The application is fundamentally broken. The frontend is polished but the
backend does not exist. Users cannot complete any core functionality.

================================================================================
CRITICAL BLOCKERS (3)
================================================================================

1. NO BACKEND SERVER EXISTS
   - The entire server/ directory specified in PROJECT_PLAN.md is missing
   - No Express app, no API routes, zero backend code
   - This is not a bug - it was never implemented

2. API ENDPOINTS DON'T EXIST
   - useAnalysis.js calls POST /api/analyze (line 227) - FAILS
   - useExport.js calls POST /api/render (line 252) - FAILS
   - Any PDF upload will result in network error

3. MOCK FUNCTIONS NOT CONNECTED
   - client.js has mockAnalyzePdf() and mockRenderPdf() functions
   - These are NEVER USED - hooks call real (non-existent) endpoints
   - Quick fix: Connect mocks to enable demo mode

================================================================================
WHAT WORKS (Frontend Only)
================================================================================

+ Dev server starts and builds successfully
+ Landing page UI renders correctly
+ All animations are implemented per spec:
  - Card entrance: fade + y-slide, 240ms
  - Card flip: rotateY with spring, 500-650ms
  - Hover effects: scale(1.02), 120ms
  - Progress bar animation
  - Confetti burst
  - Page transitions (AnimatePresence)
+ DropZone component:
  - Drag/drop visual feedback
  - File type validation (PDF only)
  - File size validation (10MB limit)
  - Magic bytes verification (blocks spoofed files)
+ PDF.js preview thumbnails render correctly
+ localStorage operations work (preferences, history)
+ Component states (loading, error, success) display correctly

================================================================================
WHAT FAILS
================================================================================

- Uploading ANY PDF -> Network error (no backend)
- Getting a tarot reading -> Impossible (no /api/analyze)
- Exporting merged PDF -> Impossible (no /api/render)
- THE ENTIRE CORE USER FLOW IS NON-FUNCTIONAL

================================================================================
TEST COVERAGE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Test Cases: 113
Ready to Execute:  78 (69%)
Blocked:           35 (31%)

Blocked tests require backend implementation before they can be run.

Categories:
- Upload validation tests: 14 ready, 5 blocked
- Animation tests: All 14 ready
- Component tests: All 16 ready
- API/Integration tests: All blocked
- Error handling tests: All blocked

================================================================================
FOUND DURING REVIEW
================================================================================

BUGS:
- BUG-001: [CRITICAL] No backend exists
- BUG-002: [CRITICAL] Mock functions disconnected from UI
- BUG-003: [HIGH] useAnalysis calls non-existent endpoint
- BUG-004: [HIGH] useExport calls non-existent endpoint
- BUG-005: [LOW] Package still named "temp-vite"

EDGE CASES IDENTIFIED:
- Password-protected PDF handling (untestable)
- Scanned/image-only PDF handling (untestable)
- Filename sanitization for special characters
- PDF.js worker CDN dependency
- localStorage quota exceeded scenario

POSITIVE FINDINGS:
- Magic bytes verification prevents file extension spoofing
- Comprehensive error messages for all failure states
- Retry logic with exponential backoff implemented
- Clean state management between views
- Blob URL cleanup after download (memory conscious)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Before any user testing):
1. Implement backend server with Express
2. Create POST /api/analyze endpoint
3. Create POST /api/render endpoint
4. OR temporarily connect mock functions to enable demo

BEFORE RELEASE:
1. Add error boundary for PDF.js failures
2. Fix package.json name
3. Test all blocked scenarios once backend exists
4. Verify PDF.js worker CDN reliability

================================================================================
FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

I found what I was looking for - a completely broken user flow! The frontend
team did solid work; the animations are slick, validation is thorough, and
error states are well-designed. But without a backend, this is an elaborate
demo that crashes the moment a user tries to actually use it.

The mock functions in client.js are RIGHT THERE waiting to be connected.
This could be a 10-minute fix to at least enable demo mode.

Cannot recommend for any form of release or user testing until backend is
implemented or mocks are connected.
