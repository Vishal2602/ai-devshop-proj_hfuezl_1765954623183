PDF TAROT READER - PM KEY DECISIONS SUMMARY
============================================
Project ID: proj_hfuezl_1765954623183

SCOPE DECISIONS
---------------
1. MVP is stateless - no file storage, no user accounts
   Rationale: Privacy by design, simpler architecture, faster to ship

2. Rule-based tarot generation (not LLM-powered)
   Rationale: Predictable behavior, no API costs, faster response times
   Future: Can add LLM option as enhancement post-MVP

3. Two-endpoint API design (/analyze + /render)
   Rationale: Separation of concerns, allows frontend to show reading before export

4. Text extraction limited to first N pages
   Rationale: Performance, most document context is upfront anyway

5. File size limit TBD (recommend 10-20MB)
   Rationale: Memory constraints in stateless processing

TECHNICAL DECISIONS
-------------------
1. Monorepo structure (client/ + server/)
   Rationale: Easier local development, shared types possible

2. TypeScript for both frontend and backend
   Rationale: Type safety, better DX, fewer runtime errors

3. pdf-lib for PDF manipulation (not puppeteer/chromium)
   Rationale: Pure JS, no browser dependencies, smaller footprint

4. Simple TF-IDF for keyword extraction
   Rationale: Good enough for MVP, no external dependencies

ANIMATION DECISIONS
-------------------
1. All animations use Framer Motion
   Rationale: Consistent API, good React integration

2. Specific timing specs locked in plan
   Rationale: Prevents "animation by committee", ensures consistency

3. layoutId for card transitions
   Rationale: Smooth stacked-to-spread animation without manual positioning

FEATURE PRIORITIZATION
----------------------
P0 (Must Have):
- PDF upload
- Text extraction
- Tarot generation
- Cover page creation
- PDF export

P1 (Should Have):
- Animated card reveals
- Progress indicators
- Success celebrations

P2 (Nice to Have):
- Preview thumbnails
- Mobile polish

OUT OF SCOPE (Said No To)
-------------------------
- User accounts
- Reading history
- Social sharing
- Multiple languages
- Custom themes
- LLM interpretations
- Persistent storage

RISK MITIGATIONS
----------------
1. Large files -> Size limits + first-N-pages extraction
2. Slow processing -> In-memory only, no disk I/O
3. PDF compatibility -> Test with various PDF types early

MILESTONE STRUCTURE
-------------------
7 milestones total:
M1: Foundation (scaffolding)
M2: PDF Processing Pipeline
M3: Tarot Generation Engine
M4: PDF Rendering
M5: Frontend Core UI
M6: Animation Polish
M7: Preview & Refinement

Each milestone has clear exit criteria.
Demo at end of each milestone.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------
- Upload to export < 10 seconds
- 60fps animations
- Works in Chrome/Firefox/Safari
- PDFs render in major viewers

OPEN QUESTIONS FOR TEAM
-----------------------
1. Exact file size limit?
2. Number of aura types to ship with?
3. QR code on cover: yes/no for MVP?
4. Confetti vs stamp animation for success state?
